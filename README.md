# AGURP_WLN
AGURP spring 2021 Research project created by Wei-Shan Huynh, Luca Elghanayan, and Nikitha Sridhar
The code with "part 1" in the title must be in the same folder as the corresponding Excel sheet, and the same goes for part 2.

Preface to part #1:
While creating this code was the first half of our project, the results ultimately were void as we discovered that our activity parameter (given to variants of our original catalyst) was, in fact, not supported by literature, leading us to shift the direction of the project.
As this section did not lead to the final conclusions of our study, the following code is given in bulk, with less labels than the following code section (Part 2 code). Graphs leading to our shift in direction to magnetic properties of catalysts are labeled.
Basis of This Portion of the Project
With an extensive list of functions for searching, labeling, and graphing, the premise of 1st Part of this project was to explore trends among properties of materials as well as different classes of materials. A user_friendly search and label system (built from the aforementioned functions) and highly adaptable graphing visulization of data, allowed for a substantial variety of compounds to be explored; ultimately FeO yielded the most interesting trends
**You must enter an api_key from Materials Project Database (MPD) below for the code to work

Outline to part #2:
(1) final list of materials with dataframes and deletion of "anomalous" materials
(2) Graphs of final list of materials
(3) How materials that fit linear trends seen in FeO were extracted from the MPD
     *(3) is listed last as it was desired to list results first. (3) is more procedural
